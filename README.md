# Iris-Flower-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements. The classification is performed using machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains measurements of Iris flowers, including:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Species (target variable)
The dataset is available in the file Iris Flower.xlsx.


# Model Performance
The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 100%
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: 1.00 for all classes

# Results
The model was able to perfectly classify all test samples into their respective species. The confusion matrix and classification report are included in the notebook.

# Acknowledgments
The dataset used in this project is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, often used for benchmarking classification algorithms.
